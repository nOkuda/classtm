# ClassTM

Class(ifying)T(opic)M(odeling) is a framework for exploring supervised anchor words, as detailed in *Is Your Anchor Going Up or Down?  Fast and Accurate Supervised Topic Models*, Nguyen et al., NAACL 2015.  It is a counterpart to [ActiveTM](https://github.com/nOkuda/activetm).  Whereas ActiveTM deals with regression tasks, ClassTM deals with classification tasks.
